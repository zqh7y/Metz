# Metz - Project About Meetings 

Making a comeback from a 5 failures apps about this idea while this 2 years of experience 
all started from GetTogetherGo app which havent even published then, 
Poster app which had sqlite servers (didnt knew the `react-native-sqlite` well and its actually use) which 
made me start a new project after a year "Metz" next future meetings app atleast in Israel #1.
<br> <br>
Project used **React Native Expo JavaScript** for Frontend also **C#** for Backend.

## Start react native expo project

***Installing Expo*** before starting
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```
***Building Project*** file & project itself
```
expo init project-name
cd  project-name
```
***Select Folder*** project just created **=>** then ***Run Expo Server***
```
npx expo start
```

## App Idea and it's features

- AI features to easier find meetings you like based on previous activity in the app using ChatGPT API by openai.
```
npm install axios
npm install openai
```
- Website specific meeting information will be shown by sending friends the meeting link (if friend doesnt have the app), otherwise the friend could put the link into the app TextInput to get the specific meeting.
- App peyment which will allow creators earn money from the app making the meeting cost money (if the meeting is public).

## Release Date

The building proccess designing, frontend, backend has done just only with 1 person so this could take ***around 2-3 months*** to build the first Metz version and publish to Google Play.
